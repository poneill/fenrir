* The sizes of things
** Upstream regions
*** 32GB
    of which,
*** 22k unique
    Presumably, every gene in hg
** Transcription factors
*** Begin with ~5k
*** Cull to 207
** Resulting data
*** Searching all utrs, 4GB of data
    Stored as compressed Python objects.
    Dictionaries of form:
: dict[upstream_region][tf] => [(position,score)]
    Impossible to load all results into memory simultaneously.
**** Strategy: uniquify, put back on disk
     Expect 33% reduction, so ~2.67GB after uniquification?  After
     uniquification, size of each chunk ~35M -> 18M X 112 chunks.
     Entire results would still likely not fit in memory.

* Literature

** Koudritsky and Domany

*** 9 genes:
- OCT4
- SOX2
- NANOG
- HNF1A
- HNF4A
- HNF6
- FOXa2
- USF1
- CREB1

*** Coverage
    -8kb to +2kb

*** How many genes per tf?
    They say: 10^2-10^3

*** Per TF distribution:
    Narrow peak at -300 bp, uniform density otherwise
