* Overview
This directory contains Python pickle files, each containing a
dictionary of transcription factor binding site scores for a given
collection of genes.  The structure of the dictionary is as follows:

Dictionary:
- Promoter :: TF 
- TF :: (position, score)

That is, each dictionary has promoters as keys and a dictionary
associating TFs with (position, score) pairs as values.

Another way of thinking through this is that a dictionary =dict= could
accept keys =promoter= and =tf= and return a list of =(position,
score)= pairs with the following syntax:

: dict[promoter][tf] # == [(position, score)]
